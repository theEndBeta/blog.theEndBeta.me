# About

**Aidan Stein (he/him)** - aka *theEndBeta* aka *greatpigeon* depending of where you're looking for me.

I'm a software engineer, self-hoster, and (pragmatic) open-source evangelist with a particular interest in the
infrastructure and systems at the heart of modern computing. I have a deep-rooted love for diving down rabbit holes when
trying to solve simple problems, and then forgetting what I actually did to solve that simple problem when I have to do
it again a few months later. Perhaps you'll find these tips and guides helpful as well!


Also, please excuse the mess while I get this site up and running. As well as being early days, design is not my forte
by any means.
